The list of constants are the following
N0: Intercept parameter in the exponential or gamma PSD [mm-1 m-3]
MU: Shape parameter in the PSD [-]
BM: exponent in the mass diameter relation M = AM * D^BM [-]
AM: intercept in the mass diameter relation M = AM * D^BM [mm^-BM kg]
BV: exponent in the velocity diameter relation V = AV * D^BV [-]
AV: intercept in the velocity diameter relation V = AV * D^BV [mm^-BM m s-1]
D_MIN: minimum considered diameter in the PSD
D_MAX: maximum considered diameter in the PSD
LAMBDA_FACTOR: constant factor used in the integration of the mass to get
    lambda of the PSD, is computed from other parameters, should not be
    changed. Note that it is precomputed to save computation time
VEL_FACTOR: constant factor used in the integration of the fall velocity
    over the PSD, is computed from other parameters, should not be
    changed
NTOT_FACTOR: constant factor used in the integration of the PSD,
     is computed from other parameters, should not be
    changed
